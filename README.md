# Percipio_Assignment2

This project is the second assignment for Percipio Learning People - Front End Introduction.
It will showcase basic functionality for Javascript coding with a small website that offers
a 10 question timed quiz that scores the result based on time as well as correct answers.

This showcases time countdowns and multiple input methods via Javascript.

Thanks to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15976245/how-to-stick-footer-element-at-the-bottom-of-the-page-html5-and-css3) for the code to 'stick' the footer to the bottom of the page.

Thanks to [Code Explained](https://www.codeexplained.dev) for the basic layout of the Quiz.

All links and functionality tested.
